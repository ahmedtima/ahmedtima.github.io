       Fatima's Kitchen aims to connect the neighborhood to a dining experience in the same way ingredients are connected to food.
   </p>
   <p>
       Eating is an agricultural act and Fatima's Kitchen is part of a larger movement to make delicious food part of the climate solution.
       At the restaurant, we are creating a market for climate beneficial ingredients.
   </p>
   <p>
       Food as it should be. Food should taste good. It should feel good. It should do good things for you and the world around you.
   </p>
   <p>
       We believe the choices we make about what we eat, where it comes from and how itâ€™s prepared have a direct and powerful 
       impact on the health of individuals, communities and the environment.
